Classification of adversaries depend on the assumed capabilities or specified intentions given in the model. The classes (types) may include adversaries who are computationally bounded or unbounded, eavesdropping or Byzantine, static or adaptive, mobile or non-mobile. The measure of the success of an adversary is called it's advantage which is the difference between the adversary's probability of successfully breaking the scheme and the probability of breaking the scheme by guessing correctly. The advantages is given as a function of the security parameter. In live attacks the adversary is called the attacker.},
