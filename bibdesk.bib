	Abstract = {Two distinct, rigorous views of cryptography have developed over the years, in two mostly separate communities. One of the views relies on a simple but effective formal approach; the other, on a detailed computational model that considers issues of complexity and probability. There is an uncomfortable and interesting gap between these two approaches to cryptography. This paper starts to bridge the gap, by providing a computational justification for a formal treatment of encryption.},

	Abstract = {Abstract. In this paper, we distinguish three important classes of dishonesty that can occur in multi-agent systems, as well as in human society. In particular, the distinction is being made between lies and bullshit, following the work of Harry Frankfurt. The difference is that someone who tells a lie has access to the truth, whereas the concept of bullshit requires no knowledge of the truth at all. That is, the liar knows that what he says is not true, whereas the bullshitter has no proper knowledge to support the statements he or she is making. We point out that different situations, in multi-agent systems as well as in human society, provide strong individual incentives for bullshit. Overall, our analysis is meant to identify some particularly troublesome issues regarding reasoning in social context.

	Abstract = {This paper extends information quality (IQ) assessment methodology by arguing that veracity/deception should be one of the components of intrinsic IQ dimensions. Since veracity/deception differs contextually from accuracy and other well-studied components of intrinsic IQ, the inclusion of veracity/deception in the set of IQ dimensions has its own contribution to the assessment and improvement of IQ. Recently developed software to detect deception in textual information represents the ready-to-use IQ assessment (IQA) instruments. The focus of the paper is on the specific IQ problem related to deceptive messages and affected information activities as well as IQA instruments (or tools) of detecting deception to improve IQ. In particular, the methodology of automated deception detection in written communication provides the basis for measuring veracity/deception dimension and demonstrates no overlap with other intrinsic IQ dimensions. Considering several known deception types (such as falsification, concealment and equivocation), we emphasize that the IQA deception tools are primarily suitable for falsification. Certain types of deception strategies cannot be spotted automatically with the existing IQA instruments based on underlying linguistic differences between truth-tellers and liars. We propose the potential avenues for the future development of the automated instruments to detect deception taking into account the theoretical, methodological and practical aspects and needs. Blending multidisciplinary research on Deception Detection with the one on IQ in Library and Information Science (LIS) and Management Information Systems (MIS), the paper contributes to IQA and its improvement by adding one more dimension, veracity/deception, to intrinsic IQ.},

	Title = {Deception Detection and Rumor Debunking for Social Media},
	Year = {2017},
	Abstract = {The main premise of this chapter is that the time is ripe for more extensive research and development of social media tools that filter out intentionally deceptive information such as deceptive memes, rumors and hoaxes, fake news or other fake posts, tweets and fraudulent profiles. Social media users' awareness of intentional manipulation of online content appears to be relatively low, while the reliance on unverified information (often obtained from strangers) is at an all-time high. I argue there is need for content verification, systematic fact-checking and filtering of social media streams. This literature survey provides a background for understanding current automated deception detection research, rumor debunking, and broader content verification methodologies, suggests a path towards hybrid technologies, and explains why the development and adoption of such tools might still be a significant challenge.

The prediction of the chances that a particular news item is intentionally deceptive is based on the analysis of previously seen truthful and deceptive news.

This paper discusses three types of fake news, each in contrast to genuine serious reporting, and weighs their pros and cons as a corpus for text analytics and predictive modeling. Filtering, vetting, and verifying online information continues to be essential in library and information science (LIS), as the lines between traditional news and online information are blurring.},

The current online news environment is one that incentivizes speed and spectacle in reporting, at the cost of fact-checking and verification. The line between user generated content and traditional news has also become increasingly blurred. This poster reviews some of the professional and cultural issues surrounding online news and argues for a two-pronged approach inspired by Hemingway's ``automatic crap detector'' (Manning, 1965) in order to address these problems: a) proactive public engagement by educators, librarians, and information specialists to promote digital literacy practices; b) the development of automated tools and technologies to assist journalists in vetting, verifying, and fact-checking, and to assist news readers by filtering and flagging dubious information.},

Deliberately deceptive (fabricated) news creates false conclusions in the readers' minds. Truthful (authentic) news matches the writer's knowledge. How do you tell the difference between the two in an automated way? To investigate this question, we analyzed rhetorical structures, discourse constituent parts and their coherence relations in deceptive and truthful news sample from NPR's ``Bluff the Listener''. Subsequently, we applied a vector space model to cluster the news by discourse feature similarity, achieving 63% accuracy. Our predictive model is not significantly better than chance (56% accuracy), though comparable to average human lie detection abilities (54%). Methodological limitations and future improvements are discussed. The long-term goal is to uncover systematic language differences and inform the core methodology of the news verification system.},

We distinguish twelve salient factors that manipulation varieties differ by (such as intentionality to deceive, accuracy, and social acceptability) to provide an abstract framework and conceptualize various permutations. Each variety then is represented as a set of features in the twelve-dimensional space. Our contributions are two-fold. In Library and Information Science (LIS) literature, a nuanced understanding of information manipulation varieties and their inter-relation lends greater awareness and sophistication to the ways we think about information and information literacy. For Natural Language Processing (NLP), the model identifies salient features for each manipulation variety, creates a potential for automated recognition and adaptability from deception detection technology to identification of other information manipulation varieties based on similarities.},

	Year = {2012},
	Abstract = {We show that homomorphic evaluation of (wide enough) arithmetic circuits can be accomplished with only polylogarithmic overhead. Namely, we present a construction of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes that for security parameter {\OE}ª can evaluate any width-{\OE}{\copyright}({\OE}ª) circuit with t gates in time t‚{\~a} polylog({\OE}ª). To get low overhead, we use the recent batch homomorphic evaluation techniques of Smart-Vercauteren and Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan, who showed that homomorphic operations can be applied to ``packed'' ciphertexts that encrypt vectors of plaintext elements. In this work, we introduce permuting/routing techniques to move plaintext elements across these vectors efficiently. Hence, we are able to implement general arithmetic circuit in a batched fashion without ever needing to ``unpack'' the plaintext vectors. We also introduce some other optimizations that can speed up homomorphic evaluation in certain cases. For example, we show how to use the Frobenius map to raise plaintext elements to powers of p at the ``cost'' of a linear operation.},

	Abstract = {We propose a generic approach to design homomorphic encryption schemes, which extends Gj{\o}steen's framework. From this generic method, we deduce a new homomorphic encryption scheme in a composite-order subgroup of points of an elliptic curve which admits a pairing e: G√{\'o}G‚{\"A}{\^a}‚{\"U}{\'\i}‚{\"A}{\^a}G t . This scheme has some interesting theoretical and practical properties: it allows an arbitrary number of multiplications in the groups G and G t , as well as a pairing evaluation on the underlying plaintexts. We prove the semantic security under chosen plaintext attack of our scheme under a generalized subgroup membership assumption, and we also prove that it cannot achieve ind-cca1 security. We eventually propose an original application to shared decryption. On the theoretical side, this scheme is an example of cryptosystem which can be naturally implemented with groups of prime order, as the homomorphic properties require only a projecting pairing using Freeman's terminology. However the application to shared decryption also relies on the fact that the pairing is cancelling and therefore does not survive this conversion.},

	Type = {Bachelors Thesis},
	Year = {2015},
	Abstract = {The security of currently used signature schemes, e.g. the RSA signature scheme, is threatened through the eventually invention of efficient quantum computers. During the last years, lattice-based cryptography turns out to be a good alternative to currently used cryptography. In this work we describe the concept of cryptographic security reductions which are used to prove the security of digital signature schemes. Further on, we define the terms bit hardness and bit security which describe how hard a problem and how secure a signature scheme is respectively. To measure the quality of a security reduction, the term tightness is defined. We show that in case of a tight security reduction breaking a signature scheme is at least as hard as solving the underlying problem. However, a non-tight security reduction leaves the possibility that breaking the scheme could be easier than solving the under- lying problem. Further on, we describe selected lattice-based signature schemes and compute the bit security, based on the security reduction of the scheme. Following this, the schemes are compared with regard to the security and the size of the signature and the key sizes.},

	Title = {Feynman. Lectures on Computation},
	Year = {1998},
	Abstract = {From 1983 to 1986, the legendary physicist and teacher Richard Feynman gave a course at Caltech called "Potentialities and Limitations of Computing Machines." Although the lectures are over ten years old, most of the material is timeless and presents a "Feynmanesque" overview of many standard and some not-so-standard topics in computer science. These include compatibility, Turing machines (or as Feynman said, "Mr. Turing's machines"), information theory, Shannon's Theorem, reversible computation, the thermodynamics of computation, the quantum limits to computation, and the physics of VLSI devices. Taken together, these lectures represent a unique exploration of the fundamental limitations of digital computers. Feynman's philosophy of learning and discovery comes through strongly in these lectures. He constantly points out the benefits of playing around with concepts and working out solutions to problems on your own - before looking at the back of the book for the answers. As Feynman says in the lectures: "If you keep proving stuff that others have done, getting confidence, increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you'll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one! And that's the way to become a computer scientist."},

Each case study describes how the author combined specific tools, ideas, and practices in order to complete a real- world research project. Emphasis is placed on the practical aspects of how the author organized his or her research to make it as reproducible as possible.

The Introduction and Part I of the book present general information about working reproducibly and synthesizes common themes from across the case studies. This summary section can be read as a stand alone introduction for beginners wishing to learn more about the general practices of reproducible research. Parts II and III of the book contain the 31 case study chapters themselves.},

	Abstract = {The Coq proof assistant provides a rich environment for interactive development of machine-checked formal reasoning. Coq is having a profound impact on research on programming languages and systems. It has been widely adopted as a research tool by the programming language research community. Last but not least, these successes have helped to spark a wave of widespread interest in dependent type theory, the richly expressive core logic on which Coq is based. The Coq team continues to develop the system, bringing significant improvements in expressiveness and usability with each new release. In short, Coq is playing an essential role in our transition to a new era of formal assurance in mathematics, semantics, and program verification.},

	Abstract = {A method of writing proofs is described that makes it harder to prove things that are not true. The method, based on hierarchical structuring, is simple and practical. The author's twenty years of experience writing such proofs is discussed.
In addition to developing the students' intuition about the beautiful concepts of analysis, it is surely equally important to persuade them that precision and rigor are neither deterrents to intuition, nor ends in themselves, but the natural medium in which to formulate and think about mathematical questions.

	Abstract = {This paper mirrors an invited talk to ISCISC 2011. It is not a conventional paper so much as an essay summarizing thoughts on a little-talked-about subject. My goal is to intermix some introspection about definitions with examples of them, these examples drawn mostly from cryptography. Underpinning our discussion are two themes. The first is that definitions are constructed. They are invented by man, not unearthed from the maws of scientific reality. The second theme is that definitions matter. They have been instrumental in changing the character of modern cryptography, and, I suspect, have the potential to change the character of other fields as well.},
