“weeks following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the President authorized the National Security Agency (NSA) to conduct a classified program to detect and prevent further attacks in the United States. As part of the NSA’s classified program, several different intelligence activities were authorized in Presidential Authorizations, and the details of these activities changed over time. The program was reauthorized by the President approximately every 45 days, with certain modifications. Collectively, the activities carried out under these Authorizations are referred to as the “President’s Surveillance Program” or “PSP.”!” ([Glenn A Fine and Gordon S Heddell, 2009, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/K77KC3ZC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PNQ72294?page=5&annotation=ASBAFP5D)) Created under G W Bush
