“Director of National Intelligence to examine the threat of foreign election influence or interference in the US general election from the time the polls close on Election Day (5 November 2024) through Inauguration Day (20 January 2025).” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=XNIXCTK7))

“after the polls close on Election Day due to lessons drawn from the 2020 election cycle.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=D3P637TK)) Got the assumption and timing way off  
timing by a decade

“at least conduct information operations denigrating US democracy through Inauguration Day.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=J6F5GGEX)) for the love of fuck why didn't you see it? It was happening for over a decade. Sigh

“and other foreign actors conducting election operations after voting ends would probably continue to use the same types of tools: information operations, cyber operations, and potentially physical threats or violence.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=A53E2IBS))

“we lack information” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=F4QDIV8Y)) NO YOU FUCKING DIDNT WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I GOT HALF OF THIS SHIT

“seek to disrupt or delay the time-sensitive and tightly sequenced series of processes and events that begin after polls close” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=Z4PDV3ZC))

“Each step, from the tabulation of votes and certification of results to completion of the Electoral College process and inauguration, is potentially susceptible to foreign influence and interference operations in different ways” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=5YEJMJYI))

“consider stoking unrest and conducting localized cyber operations to disrupt election infrastructure.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=J6YT2CMF))

“operations that could affect voting or official counts are less likely because they are more difficult and bring a greater risk of US retaliation.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=I6VGG4SR)) I mean they very minimally did called in a few bomb threats because they knew you would be expecting something and silence would have been uncharacteristic. But the plans were well in place, solidly tested with built plans A, B, C, and so on well set, months ahead which why the fuck didn’t you know that? wtf happened?

“amplify discord, including after the breach of the US Capitol on 6 January 202” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=1&annotation=W3XDEHEJ))

“Foreign adversaries will almost certainly conduct information operations after voting ends to create uncertainty and undermine the legitimacy of the election process.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=2&annotation=YW8GHHUX)) omfg

“undocumented immigrants and deceased individuals” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=2&annotation=TGM3WJ8S)) guess who else did?

“China, Iran, and Russia capitalized on the events of6 January 2021 to denigrate the US political system, though we have no indication any foreign actor was involved in planning or executing the siege” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=2&annotation=HKDASBCG)) are you fucking serious?

“7 January, a Russian official directed Russian media to exploit the US Capitol violence as an opportunity to disparage the United States,” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=2&annotation=8KMTC4NC))

“PRC and various Iranian government officials also cited the attack in narratives characterizing the US as a declining power,” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=2&annotation=4TU2WSGM)) that narrative isn’t even recent

“WV assess foreign actors are positioned to use cyber operations and espionage to sow doubt about the integrity of the election and collect data, judging from cyber actors’ prior activities.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=2&annotation=DDLIDBZR))

“disrupt or alter public-facing state government and news websites to promote confusion about election results; claim they have interfered in the election, even if false,” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=2&annotation=YANSVHD7))

“February, IRGC cyber actors had accessed a network domain associated with a US state government’s division of elections and probably obtained data on voter registration and on whether or not some of the registered individuals voted” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=3&annotation=Z3UTWHA6))

“Iran and Russia are probably willing to at least consider tactics that could foment or contribute to violent protests, and may threaten, or amplify threats of, physical violence in the post-Election Day time frame.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=3&annotation=HBDRCAUM))

“Trump and other former US officials, which are likely to persist after voting ends,” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=X4K5LFGD))

not likely

“May and June, Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) encouraged a US person via social media, including by offering to send money for travel, to attend a pro-Palestinian protest in Washington, DC.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=XBHXKVB6))

“mid-December 2020, IRGC cyber actors were almost certainly responsible for the creation of a website containing death threats against US election officials,” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=NLD4PRGN)) they have APT;s and you think that’s how they use them?

“Iranian actors also published personally identifiable information about US federal and state officials to try to incite violence.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=YC86E86A)) see that’s more likely

“We assess that some US adversaries—at a minimum China, Iran, and Russia or Russian-affiliated actors—have the technical capability to access some US election-related networks and systems.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=GW76YV67))

“we assess foreign actors will probably refrain from disruptive attacks that seek to alter vote counts because they almost certainly would not be able to tangibly impact the outcome of the federal election without detection;” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=5RHS666V)) there you go again with the american view assumptions

“such activity would carry a risk of retaliation,” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=XWAAYIUX)) stop repeating this mistake specifically, you’ve been doing it for decades

“in February, Killnet 2.0, a pro-Russia cyber group, announced its intent to interfere with the 2024 US election—though it did not specify how—before deleting the post” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=URECTQEF))

“We cannot, for example, rule out the possibility of an inadvertent attack in which an effort to procure ransom payments from a victim unexpectedly crashes systems needed for election activities, or a situation in which a software or security update goes awry.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=4&annotation=Y3WZJ3PF)) "inadvertent"

“We assess they would most likely concentrate on states and races consistently identified as too close to call, although media coverage about how close the election is shaping up to be might lead them to cast a wider net and include some states and races on which there is less focus” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=5&annotation=VS6SWF4A))

“Foreign actors mostly likely judge that cyberattacks against public-facing websites—such as pro-Russian cyber actors’ DDoS attack in 2022—or claims of hacking election infrastructure will resonate or increase doubt during this period and could undermine confidence in the accuracy of the election outcome.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=5&annotation=VFR76N2Q))

“Vote casting machines in polling stations are by standard practice not connected to the Intemet or to each other, and most methods for exploiting them require physical access.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=5&annotation=5LNFRVE7))

“The overwhelming majority of registered American voters—estimated at more than 97 percent in this election—live in jurisdictions where the voting systems produce a paper record that voters can verify and provide a paper audit trail.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=5&annotation=GIT76XUG)) paper audit trail  
97%

“Since at least January 2017, when election infrastructure was designated critical infrastructure, the Federal Government has seen no evidence that a foreign actor has impacted voter data integrity, the ability to vote, the tabulation of votes, or the timely transmission of election results” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=5&annotation=PENIHSZ7))

“Foreign-driven or -amplified violent protests, violence, or physical threats to election workers or state and local officials could challenge state and local officials’ ability to conduct elements of the certification and Electoral College process, particularly if they prevent necessary physical access to facilities or venues” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=6&annotation=C4N8HCIN))

“Adversaries’ efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power probably would hinge on information operations introduced in earlier phases of the process that succeeded in fomenting or amplifying lingering protests or physical threats to the inauguration ceremony itself.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=6&annotation=7N4PXZVT)) THEY WERE MONTHS BEFORE HAND ALL THREE TIMES

“capitalize on the opportunity to denigrate the US political system” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=6&annotation=7678G98E)) omg you guys come on

“A multi-pronged approach that includes direct warnings to adversaries, public messaging to Americans that prebunks or debunks false narratives, and proactive communication between local officials and law enforcement has the best chance of thwarting foreign influence efforts after the election.” ([NIO for Counterintelligence, 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/W8HEAIXZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ULWCE73?page=6&annotation=99YHAGU8)) so you do know prebunking exists just kinda theoretically?
