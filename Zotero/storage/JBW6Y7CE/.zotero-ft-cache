Trump and other former US officials, which are likely to persist after voting ends, regardless of the projected outcome.
• Foreign adversaries that have demonstrated a willingness to encourage participation in non-election-related, First Amendment-protected protests may extend this practice to any potential violent protests in the post-election period to further widen domestic divides. In January, a GRU unit sought to recruit a probably unwitting US person to organize protests in the United States. In May and June, Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) encouraged a US person via social media, including by offering to send money for travel, to attend a pro-Palestinian protest in Washington, DC.
• Iran could use cyber-enabled influence operations that lead to physical threats, including doxing and leaking of sensitive information. In mid-December 2020, IRGC cyber actors were almost certainly responsible for the creation of a website containing death threats against US election officials, The Iranian actors also published personally identifiable information about US federal and state officials to try to incite violence.
Cyberattacks Against Election Infrastructure. We assess that some US adversaries—at a minimum
China, Iran, and Russia or Russian-affiliated actors—have the technical capability to access some US election-related networks and systems. That said, we assess foreign actors will probably refrain from disruptive attacks that seek to alter vote counts because they almost certainly would not be able to tangibly impact the outcome of the federal election without detection; such activity would carry a risk of retaliation, and there is no indication they attempted such attacks during the past two election cycles.

Separately, in February, Killnet 2.0, a pro-Russia cyber group, announced its intent to interfere with the 2024 US election—though it did not specify how—before deleting the post.
• In addition, nonstate foreign actors, such as hacktivists, cybercriminals, and terrorists, may have lower thresholds for cyber or physical attacks. We cannot, for example, rule out the possibility of an inadvertent attack in which an effort to procure ransom payments from a victim unexpectedly crashes systems needed for election activities, or a situation in which a software or security update goes awry.
Adversaries Could Target Various Post-Election Day Process Vulnerabilities
Foreign adversaries are likely to perceive varying opportunities to undermine each stage of the post-voting process. This period also has a sequence of deadlines that, if missed, could disrupt the normal process and have cascading and varied effects on later stages of the process.
Tabulation and Unofficial Reporting. Official vote tabulation is highly secure, but adversaries might exploit the period of uncertainty before results are finalized to spread disinformation about the counting process and use cyber operations to reinforce the credibility of those narratives.

Adversaries’ messaging campaigns also may also seek to amplify any protests that could interfere with the certification process.
• Foreign-driven or -amplified violent protests, violence, or physical threats to election workers or state and local officials could challenge state and local officials’ ability to conduct elements of the certification and Electoral College process, particularly if they prevent necessary physical access to facilities or venues. Some states require the certification of election results or the meeting of electors for the Electoral College to be in-person or at a specific point of time and do not have laws that allow for variation in the procedure, such as by switching to a virtual forum, which adds to the risk of a disruption.
After 6 January to Inauguration. Adversaries’ efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power probably would hinge on information operations introduced in earlier phases of the process that succeeded in fomenting or amplifying lingering protests or physical threats to the inauguration ceremony itself. If protests persist in this period, foreign actors are likely to further capitalize on the opportunity to denigrate the US political system and fan protests—as they did in the 2020 election cycle
A multipronged approach that includes direct warnings to adversaries, public messaging to Americans that prebunks or debunks false narratives, and proactive communication between local officials and law enforcement has the best chance of thwarting foreign influence efforts after the election. US adversaries’ longstanding interest in undermining American democracy suggests it will be difficult to dissuade them from engaging during the post-election period.
