HE Commercial Accumulation of Data Raises Stakes of Breaches
(QE Commercial enterprises’ collection and aggregation of vast quantities of personal data, as well as their willingness to share it with third parties, increases both the likelihood and the impact of data breaches. Since 2013, authoritarian states have stolen huge amounts of personal data, including from US firms.

© (U) Data brokers are a prime target because they draw from thousands of sources to aggregate categories of information. Among the categories are demographics, home and neighborhood, occupation, education, purchases, property ownership, income and financial status, health details, vehicle information, personal interests, travel, social media and technology habits, ethnicity, and religious and political affiliation
(U) China Postured To Expand CyberEnabled Authoritarian Efforts Abroad
HE We assess that Beijing will have increasing opportunities to use commercial channels to exert its digital authoritarianism in the next few years. Beijing will be able to exploit Chinese companies’ expansion of telecommunications infrastructures and digital services, these enterprises’ growing presence in the daily lives ofpopulations worldwide, and Beijing’s rising global economic and political influence. Beijing has demonstrated its willingness to enlist the aid of Chinese commercial enterprises to help surveil and censor regime enemies abroad.
Hl We assess that Beijing’s commercial access to personal data of other countries’ citizens, along with AL driven analytics, will enable it to automate the identification of individuals and groups beyond China’s borders to target with propaganda or censorship. Such access and analytics also will enable Beijing to tailor its use of a range of online and offline carrots and sticks to its targets outside China—potentially on a large scale.

HE A dversaries Exporting Approach
HE «We judge that China and Russia are using digital authoritarian capabilities to aid their allies and are allowing their firms to sell equipment and knowhow on the open market. Their efforts and sales go beyond what Western firms offer—such as Al-driven facial recognition and the ubiquitous surveillance environments marketed as “safe cities” that enable states’ monitoring and suppression of their populace.
