TERRORIST IDENTITIES DATAMART ENVIRONMENT (TIDE)
What is TIDE?
The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) is the US Government’s central repository of information on international terrorist identities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established NCTC to serve as the “central and shared knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorists and international terror groups.” TIDE, which contains both classified and unclassified information, is that knowledge bank. It supports the US Government’s various terrorist screening efforts by supplying identities to the unclassified Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), which resides in the FBI-led Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The TSDB, commonly referred to as “the Watchlist,” supplies databases “downstream” with identifiers used for screening.
To the extent permitted by law, the TIDE database includes information the US Government (USG) possesses related to the identities of individuals known or appropriately suspected to be or to have been involved in activities constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism (with the exception of purely domestic terrorism information). This information is available to counterterrorism professionals throughout the Intelligence Community via the webbased, read-only “TIDE Online.”
All activities at NCTC are guided by our strong commitment to protect privacy and civil liberties. As such, a person cannot be watchlisted based solely upon First Amendment protected activity.
What types of conduct warrant inclusion in TIDE?
Federal agencies nominate individuals for inclusion in TIDE based on evaluations of intelligence and law enforcement terrorism information. Types of conduct that warrant inclusion in TIDE include persons who: Commit international terrorist activity; Prepare or plan international terrorist activity; Gather information on potential targets for international terrorist activity; Solicit funds or valuables for international terrorist activity or a terrorist organization; Solicit membership in an international terrorist organization; Provide material support, e.g., safe house, transportation, or training; Are members of or represent a foreign terrorist organization.

How is information from TIDE used for screening purposes?
Analysts create and enhance TIDE records based on a daily review of nominations received. NCTC exports a sensitive but unclassified subset of the data containing the terrorist identifiers to the TSC in near real-time for use in the TSDB. TIDE and the TSDB are critical in the screening of individuals, to include all travelers to the United States, as well as refugee, visa, and visa waiver program applicants. TIDE and TSDB are critical tools for homeland security, supplying identities to the Transportation Security Administration’s “No Fly” list, among others.

How many people are in TIDE?
As of October 2020, TIDE contained about 2.5 million people. US Persons (both citizens and lawful permanent residents) account for less than 1% of the total.
Why are people without terrorist ties sometimes delayed when traveling?
TIDE and many downstream screening systems are name-based, meaning that people with names similar to those in the database may be stopped for additional screening by TSA or at a port of entry. People may use the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Traveler Redress Inquiry Program, which was launched in February 2007, to request resolution of possible watchlist misidentification issues with any of DHS components at http://www.dhs.gov/trip.
Are names removed from TIDE?
Yes. In the past five years, NCTC has deleted about 100,000 person records from TIDE after they were determined to no longer meet the criteria for inclusion.
