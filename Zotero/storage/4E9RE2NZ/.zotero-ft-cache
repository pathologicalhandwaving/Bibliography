Question: Is there any truth to story where rabbits “attacked” Napoleon and his hunting party?
Is it an exaggerated story, made up story made by a jealous officer or flat-out lie made by the
coalition?

The story appeared for the first time on 10 September 1800 in the Journal des hommes libres
de tous les pays, a Revolutionary newspaper.
You have often heard,” she said, “stories of boring or disgusting flattery, and I am going
to tell you one that is very cheerful, and I am sorry that it is old.”
One of the last Roman emperors was concerned with the administration of the state after
a long and glorious war. He didn’t know what a courtier was: he learned about them
through an adventure that delighted him greatly by giving him the opportunity to
appreciate them. When the emperor arrived, one of the chiefs of the aruspices, who, to
please his master, had exchanged his costume for an almost warlike garb, was
assiduously courting the prince; on the lookout for his slightest desires, he was there to
satisfy them, and had it been up to the emperor to demand of him the humblest
domestic services, he would have found in Pantakaka (as he was called) boundless
docility. His attentions were pushed to the point where they became tiresome. One day,
the emperor felt like spending one of the beautiful summer days in Tusculum. After the
morning’s work, he took his bow and went alone into the nearby forest to shoot some
birds or other unfortunate inhabitants of the woods. Pantakaka discovered that the
emperor was in the forest; he ran there, joined him and tried to strike up one of his
ordinary conversations with him.
It is a surprising thing, he said, the analogy between the tastes of the emperor and mine.
As soon as the business with which I am charged leaves me a moment free, I run to my
house in the fields, I take my bow and amuse myself by shooting rabbits. - So you have
rabbits in your country? Yes, my lord, and lots of them. - In that case, I’ll go at the end of


 the moon: we’ll have a hunting party. Pantakaka bowed and withdrew. The problem was
to provide the emperor with the promised amusement. The courtier did have a small
park, but not a single rabbit tail. Finally, on the advice of one of his friends, he arranged
for the purchase on the public market of those animals that the city’s purveyors fed for
the daily use of the inhabitants. Two hundred rabbits were set free in the park, but soon
it was realised that a blunder had been made. As soon as someone entered the park, the
animals thought they were being fed and ran to meet the first person who came along.
We tried in vain to whip them away and force them to flee, but hunger and habit dictated
otherwise. The emperor was assailed by the touching caresses of these little animals
that he had expected to pursue. He laughed a lot at his courtier and at the new little
court around him. It is said that whenever he spoke of this adventure, he declared that he
had never had so many good animals around him.
Published almost one year after Bonaparte’s coup of 10 November 1799, the story is a
transparent anecdote featuring Talleyrand (“Pantakaka”) and Bonaparte (“the Emperor”). It is
more critical of Talleyrand than of Bonaparte, who in this version is not chased by the rabbits
but plays with them. The newspaper was banned 4 days later.
The story reappeared 10 years later in a pamphlet by Lewis Goldsmith, an Anglo-French
publicist and fervent Revolutionary who had worked for Talleyrand and Bonaparte. Goldsmith
eventually became a strong opponent to Napoléon, publishing The Secret History of the
Cabinet of Bonaparte in 1811, where he told the story as follows:
A journal, which I have already had occasion to mention, the “Journal des Hommes
Libres,” related a plaisanterie played off upon Bonaparte by Talleyrand, after his
becoming Consul, though not intentionally. The former observed, that he was very fond
of shooting and hunting, and asked him if he had any game near his estate at Neuilly?
The latter, knowing that his new master never shot or hunted any thing else than his own
species, told him he had some wild ducks and wild rabbits: which was not the case. He
put tame animals in his way, thinking they would do as well as the others. When
Bonaparte arrived, instead of the rabbits running away at his approach, they came and
licked his boots ; which very much enraged him. - This story was told as if it had
happened to an oriental prince ; and Talleyrand was called the Minister Pantakaka, (a
Greek word,) which signifies the ready instrument of all evil. The Journal was
suppressed, and the editor deported!
Note that in Goldsmith’s version Bonaparte is “enraged” and not delighted as in the original
tale. Goldsmith’s book was later translated in French, which probably helped to popularize the


 anecdote.
The story was more or less confirmed by Louis Constant Wairy, Napoleon’s valet, who alludes
to it in his (ghostwritten) memoirs published in 1830, in a story featuring César Berthier
(brother of Louis-Alexandre Berthier, who organised hunts for Napoléon) and Talleyrand.
Constant, when discussing a hunt organised for Talleyrand in Italy, briefly mentions that the
Prince once offered Bonaparte a rabbit hunt.
One fine day César Berthier got it into the prince’s [Talleyrand] head that he should
organise some hunting parties. From then on, our pikemen were busy blowing their horns
and some of the King of Sardinia’s former hunters were rehearsing their tayaut and halali.
The day of the first proper hunt was therefore set; but power, even imperial power, has
its limits; it cannot make game where there is none, and we did not have at our disposal
the resources that M. de Talleyrand had previously found at the Quai de la Vallée, to offer
the First Consul the entertainment of a rabbit hunt. Besides, we had a great disdain for
rabbits... Rabbits! They were fine under the Republic; but then we needed a good stag, or
at least a fallow deer.
In Constant’s story, an “almost domestic” fallow deer was taken from an estate nearby and
released in Talleyrand’s park, where the “poor deer” ran for merely an hour. Talleyrand, as a
Prince, was supposed to slit the animal’s throat but refused out of disgust and let a hunting
valet do it.
The fullest and most colorful version of the story was published in 1894 in the posthumous
memoirs of general Paul Thiébault, an officer who had fought for the Republic since 1792 and
later for the Empire, and who had retired after the fall of the Emperor in 1815.
Here is the anecdote in full:
As a good courtier, Alexandre Berthier [...] imagined and offered the Emperor a rabbit
hunt in a park he owned on the outskirts of Paris and was happy to see it accepted.
Everything that could make this hunt enjoyable, everything except rabbits, was present in
this property; but as no game was more common, the Marshal and Major General, who
was used to thinking of and providing for everything, judged that he would be a hundred
times better at this after having ordered that a thousand of these animals be released in
the park for the morning of the day on which the Emperor was to hunt there. Such orders
are not carried out half-heartedly, and not one rabbit was missing from the thousand
requested. At last everything was ready; the Emperor was expected, the Emperor had
arrived; he had been served a splendid lunch; already the incidental was giving way to


 the principal; the hunt was under way, and Berthier was overjoyed to have been allowed
the honour of providing his master with an opportunity to make a name for himself
through a salutary amusement. But how could we say it or believe it? All these rabbits,
which, even when separated, would have tried in vain to escape the blows intended for
them by the most august hand, suddenly gathered in herds, soon en masse; instead of
resorting to a useless flight, they all turned around, and suddenly the whole phalanx
rushed at Napoleon. The surprise was at its height, as was Berthier’s anger; proud of
finally finding a decisive opportunity to appeal a cruel word that had escaped the First
Consul on the battlefield of Marengo (1), he set off at their head. With the rabbits on the
run, Napoleon was delivered; This episode was already regarded as nothing more than a
delay, bizarre no doubt, but fortunately over, when, by a triple conversion to the right and
left, these intrepid rabbits turned the Emperor, attacking him from behind with an
unspeakable frenzy, never letting go, They would not let go, they would pile up on his
legs to the point of tripping him up, and they would force the winner of the world’s
winners to retreat and cede the battlefield to them, although it was fortunate that some
of these rabbits, having climbed onto the Emperor’s carriages, did not make it back to
Paris in triumph.
All that remained was to understand this phenomenon, and all was revealed as soon as it
was learned that the executor of Berthier’s orders, unaware that there could be any
difference between a rabbit and a rabbit, had bought hutch rabbits instead of wild
rabbits, with the result that these poor rabbits had mistaken the hunters, including the
Emperor, for cabbage cutters, and that they had pounced on them and returned to them
all the more greedily because they had not eaten since the previous day. You can guess
the laughter that this revelation provoked and how much, in the presence of so many
witnesses, it added to the despair of Berthier, who, ashamed and confused, deploring
the fact and the ridiculousness of the fact, swore, but a little late, that he would no longer
be deceived.
(1) The general-in-chief of the reserve army having weakened considerably at a critical
moment, General Bonaparte exclaimed: “Berthier has none of that which, it is said,
makes a brave man.”
Is the story true? Thiébault’s memoirs remained unpublished for 80 years, though the
manuscript was shown to other people. Perhaps he felt that the memoirs were too personal: in
the foreword of 1893, editor Fernand Calmettes called them a confession in the manner of
Jean-Jacques Rousseau. There are indeed full of entertaining anecdotes about himself and
people he knew: he was the one who told the story of General Lasalle sneaking behind enemy


 line to visit his Italian lover, among other juicy tales. The timeframe of Thiebault’s version 
sometimes after the battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800 - is compatible with the one
published in the Journal des hommes libres in September 1800.
According to Berthier’s biographer Jérôme Zieseniss (1985), the story is too good to be true,
and Zieseniss thinks that this was a dig at Berthier, whom Thiébault believed to be
responsible for his lack of career advancement:
The anecdote is amusing, but the indisputable competence of Berthier’s three hunting
assistants (Girardin, d’Hanneucourt and Pernet) makes it implausible. It is a slander
invented out of thin air, and one of the most innocent that this general, a bitter critic of
the Vice-Connétable [Berthier], allowed himself to tell.
In his extensive book about Napoléon’s hunts, Charles-Éloi Vial (2016) does include the rabbit
story as an example of the kind of danger or ridicule Napoléon exposed himself to when
hunting. Napoléon liked hunting and anti-Napoleon writings and caricatures used this to
portray him as bloodthirsty, since the game animals were often tame ones bought beforehand
and set free before the hunt, as shown in the rabbit story and in the deer story told by
Constant. However, Napoléon was not a good hunter and he was a terrible shot: two people 
a hunting beater named Dufour and general André Masséna - lost an eye because of him and
he also shot a valet in the thigh by accident. He also fell several times, was once almost
skewered by a wild boar, and had a gun explode in his hands.
The core version of the rabbit story - a rabbit hunt was once organized for Bonaparte circa
1800 but the rabbits were domestic ones who refused to act as proper game animals - is
probably true. The other stuff - Napoléon petting the rabbits, or being enraged at Talleyrand,
or fleeing from them, are embellishments created for specific purposes: an attack on
Talleyrand (Journal des hommes libres), an attack on Napoléon (Goldsmith), a juicy tale and
an attack on Berthier (Thiébault).

Followup
Thank you so much for your detailed answer and I have one more question. Did Napoleon ever
acknowledged the rumours by denying it? Since he liked hunting it must have angered him.
Answer
Not that we know. Napoléon did not talk much about hunting. He enjoyed it as a physical
exercise or as a political tool but did not care much about the hunt itself, being neither a good
horseman nor a good shot (and aware of it). He was the most famous person in Europe, a star
in the emerging mass media, so there were thousands of such anecdotes, true or not,
published in newspapers and pamphlets, and he could not have commented on all of them,
notably one as gentle as this one (and the version that shows him fleeing the rabbits only
appeared in public in 1894 anyway).
I actually missed a few other versions of the story. In one told by Stendahl (Henri Beyle) in
1827, the story also includes, in addition to tame rabbits, a wild boar that turns out to be a pig,
and ends with Bonaparte being angry at Talleyrand, that “rascal of a priest”, for pranking him.
Another version, possibly the most plausible, can be found in the memoirs (1828) of Stanislas
de Girardin, a friend of Joseph Bonaparte. This took place on 28 August 1800 (so in the same
timeframe as the other versions):
Neighbourly relations led me to intimate relations with Joseph Bonaparte. The First
Consul was at Mortefontaine, at his brother’s ; he came this morning for lunch at
Ermenonville. We began by giving him the pleasure of hunting rabbits in the desert
[English landscape garden]. Some of these rabbits, less savage than the others, were so


 curious to admire the hero of the Italian army that, far from fleeing, they ran to gather
around him. The First Consul took a singular pleasure in this new spectacle, the secret of
which he came to suspect.
In any case, the mechanics of the story remain the same, but the output is different. But as I
said, people kept telling stories about Napoleon all the time, discussing the color of his semen
or that time when Joséphine’s dog Fortuné had bitten him after the Emperor had tried to climb
into the marital bed.
